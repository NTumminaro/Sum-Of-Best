# Sum of Best

## Description

An application for the speed-running community to compare times and notes.


- The motivation to build this application, was to have a better way to share notes on speed-runs.

- We built this project, to be able to better communicate with other runners.

- This application solves the problem of not having access to other peoples notes about runs.

- In this process, we learned the magic of backend.
