# Sum of Best

## Description

An application for the speed-running community to compare games and notes.


- The motivation to build this application, was to have a better way to share notes on speedruns.

- We built this project, to be able to better communicate with other runners.

- This application solves the problem of not having access to other peoples notes for runs.

- In this process, we learned the magic of backend.
